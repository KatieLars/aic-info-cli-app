  #@@all is a hash that keeps track of how many of each Event type there is. Keys are EventType objects and values are the number of that type.
  #Types should only be added to EventType iff there isn't already one present in the hash. Otherwise, the values for the
    #appropriate key should tick up one.
  #Control for type: events should always be Event objects
